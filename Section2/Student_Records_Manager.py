Project Overview

The Student Records Manager manages student data using dictionaries and sets.
Each student record includes their name, age, grades, and courses.
Key operations include adding students, updating grades, checking course enrollment,
calculating average grades, listing students by course, and filtering top students based on grade thresholds.

This project demonstrates the practical use of dictionaries for structured data, sets to handle duplicates,
and advanced decision-making for efficient data management. Itâ€™s a practical way to apply Python concepts in a real-world scenario.


Challenge task7

Easy
Create a function named filter_top_students that takes one argument: threshold (float). The function should:

Iterate through the student_records dictionary and find all students whose average grade is greater than the specified threshold.
Use the calculate_average_grade function to get each student's average grade.
Return a list of names of the top students.
If no students meet the criteria, return an empty list.
Add (replace) the following block of code at the bottom of your code:

add_student("Alice", 20, ["Math", "Physics"])
add_student("Bob", 22, ["Math", "Biology"])
add_student("Diana", 23, ["Chemistry", "Physics"])
add_grade("Alice", 90)
add_grade("Alice", 85)
add_grade("Bob", 75)
add_grade("Diana", 95)
print(filter_top_students(80))  # Should return ["Alice", "Diana"]
print(filter_top_students(90))  # Should return ["Diana"]
print(filter_top_students(100))  # Should return an empty list

Take a moment to reflect on how youâ€™ve combined dictionaries, sets,
and decision-making to create a fully functional program. Great job! ðŸš€
