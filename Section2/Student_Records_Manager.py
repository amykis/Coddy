Project Overview

The Student Records Manager manages student data using dictionaries and sets.
Each student record includes their name, age, grades, and courses.
Key operations include adding students, updating grades, checking course enrollment,
calculating average grades, listing students by course, and filtering top students based on grade thresholds.

This project demonstrates the practical use of dictionaries for structured data, sets to handle duplicates,
and advanced decision-making for efficient data management. Itâ€™s a practical way to apply Python concepts in a real-world scenario.


Challenge task4

Easy
Create a function named is_enrolled that takes two arguments: name (string) and course (string). The function should:

Check if the student name exists in the student_records dictionary.
If it does not exist, print "Student '<name>' not found." and return False.
If the name exists, check if the course is in the student's courses set.
If it is, return True.
If not, return False.
Add (replace) the following block of code at the bottom of your code:

add_student("Alice", 20, ["Math", "Physics"])
add_student("Bob", 22, ["Biology", "Chemistry"])
add_grade("Alice", 90)
add_grade("Alice", 85)
add_grade("Bob", 75)
add_grade("Charlie", 80)  # Non-existent student
print(is_enrolled("Alice", "Math"))  # Should return True
print(is_enrolled("Alice", "Biology"))  # Should return False
print(is_enrolled("Bob", "Biology"))  # Should return True
print(is_enrolled("Charlie", "Math"))  # Non-existent student, should print message and return False
