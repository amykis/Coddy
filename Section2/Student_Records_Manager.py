Project Overview

The Student Records Manager manages student data using dictionaries and sets.
Each student record includes their name, age, grades, and courses.
Key operations include adding students, updating grades, checking course enrollment,
calculating average grades, listing students by course, and filtering top students based on grade thresholds.

This project demonstrates the practical use of dictionaries for structured data, sets to handle duplicates,
and advanced decision-making for efficient data management. Itâ€™s a practical way to apply Python concepts in a real-world scenario.


Challenge task6

Easy
Create a function named list_students_by_course that takes one argument: course (string). The function should:

Iterate through the student_records dictionary and find all students enrolled in the specified course.
Return a list of names of students who are enrolled in the course.
If no students are enrolled in the course, return an empty list.
Add (replace) the following block of code at the bottom of your code:

add_student("Alice", 20, ["Math", "Physics"])
add_student("Bob", 22, ["Math", "Biology"])
add_student("Diana", 23, ["Chemistry", "Physics"])
print(list_students_by_course("Math"))  # Should return ["Alice", "Bob"]
print(list_students_by_course("Physics"))  # Should return ["Alice", "Diana"]
print(list_students_by_course("Biology"))  # Should return ["Bob"]
print(list_students_by_course("History"))  # Should return an empty list
